I am a PhD student at the Université du Luxembourg supervised by [Sylvain Kubler](sylvainkubler.fr). My work focuses on the trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models, with an industrial application to autonomous driving systems.

I wanted my academic journey guided by curiosity and a drive to explore. While starting university by digging into math, physics and computer science, my interest in Artificial Intelligence systems and its potential to transform our understanding of technology and the human mind began to grow. This led me to internships in natural language processing, with focuses on classification and summarization systems. My interest for the human mind and intelligence (concrete this one :wink:) guided me to apply machine learning to cognitive sciences, where I tried to use vision and unsupervised deep learning to model the human process of perceiving biological motion. These multiple research experiences gave me the inspiration to pursue a PhD and contribute to the cutting edge of AI.
