# Welcome!

I am a PhD student at the Universit√© du Luxembourg supervised by [Sylvain Kubler](https://www.sylvainkubler.fr). My work focuses on the trustworthiness of Multimodal Large Language Models, with an industrial application to autonomous driving systems.

I wanted my academic journey to be guided by curiosity exploration. While starting university by digging into math, physics and computer science, my interest in Artificial Intelligence and its potential to transform our understanding of technology and human began to grow. Multiple internships involving research in natural language processing, multimodal machine learning and cognitive sciences got me to become familiar with the field and gave me the inspiration to pursue a PhD and contribute to the cutting edge of AI.
